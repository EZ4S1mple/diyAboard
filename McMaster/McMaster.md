## Required Documents

**Please make sure that you fill out your name correctly. If you are offered an admission to McMaster University, we will register you under the name that appears on your application form. Your name should be consistent with your passport, birth certificate, social insurance number, etc. unless your personal situation changes.

*ALL REQUIRED DOCUMENTS MUST BE UPLOADED TO YOUR APPLICATION PRIOR TO HITTING “SUBMIT”. If any of the requested material is not uploaded at the time of application, your application may be declined without review. Once you hit “submit”, nothing can be changed/deleted/added.*

**NOTE**: a complete application is required for review; applications deemed incomplete will not be reviewed. To ensure that your application is complete, please review this checklist of required documents before you apply. Details on each item are provided below:

- Official Academic Transcripts and Degree Completion Certificates
- Statement of Interest
- Resume/CV
- ELP (TOEFL/IELTS) Scores (if applicable)
- Proof of Permanent Resident Status (if applicable)
- 2 Academic References (read carefully)

**Please Note**: Any submitted documents will not be returned, nor will they be transferred to another department within McMaster University.

#### Official Academic Transcripts and Degree Completion Certificates

Electronic academic transcripts for ALL post-secondary studies completed or in progress at the time of application must be included in your application. Transcripts must show all courses and marks (where applicable), along with the transcripts’ legends/keys/grading schemes. If you are presented with an offer, it will be conditional that you provide us with the original copies at a later date. If the final transcript does not show that a completed degree has been conferred, an official/notarized copy of your diploma is also required.

#### Statement of Interest

The statement of interest should be uploaded to your application as a PDF file; without it, your application will be deemed incomplete. This document should be a few paragraphs indicating the type of research you are interested in pursuing; how your education and experience aligns with research areas in the Department of Computing and Software; any contributions you hope to make to research initiatives during your study and how you plan to make them (methods, approach) and finally evidence of your ability to work collaboratively and independently. This statement helps faculty members identify prospective graduate students for their program.

#### Resume/CV

Like with the statement of interest, your resume/CV should be uploaded to your application as a PDF file; without it, your application will be deemed incomplete. It should be in the same format as you would submit for an employment opportunity.

#### English Language Proficiency Scores (if applicable)

Your ELP scores should be uploaded to your application as a PDF file as well as the original sent to the department graduate administrator. Your application will be deemed incomplete if these scores are not included.

English comprehension and communication (oral and written) are necessary for learning and research at McMaster University, as English is the language of instruction. You will be required to satisfy a certain level of English language proficiency (ELP) to gain admission to our programs IF the following points are true for you:

1. English is not your native language; and
2. English is not the language of instruction at your previous institution*

Proof of English proficiency can be satisfied by providing any of the following test results from tests taken within 2 years of the application deadline:

1. TOEFL Scores:
   1. Minimum 550 – written test
   2. Minimum 213 – computer-based test
   3. Minimum score of 88
      1. (To ensure your TOEFL score is received by this department, please indicate Institution Code 0936 and Department Code 78 when requesting your transcripts from the TOEFL testing centre.)
2. IELTS Scores:
   1. Test MUST be academic; not general
   2. Minimum overall score of 6.5
   3. Minimum score of 5.5 for each section

*If English IS the language of instruction at your previous institution, you can be exempted from the ELP requirement by providing either:

\1. an official letter from your previous institution stating that the language of instruction is English, OR

\2. official transcripts which state that English is the language of instruction.

Proof of Permanent Resident / Landed Immigrant Status (if applicable)

For permanent residents/landed immigrant only: if your VISA STATUS lists “Permanent Resident of Canada” or “Landed Immigrant”, you must upload a scan of your permanent residence card (front and back) or Record of Landing (IMM1000) to your application.

#### Two Academic References

Before beginning your application, you should obtain the consent of two instructors who are familiar with your academic work to provide confidential reference reports. You are not required to submit reference letters as part of your application; however, you must list your references and their contact information in your application. By entering the email addresses of your references through your online application, McMaster’s Electronic Referencing (e-reference) system will send your referees an e-reference request on your behalf.

**IMPORTANT**: the system will send the e-reference request to your referees ONLY AFTER YOU SUBMIT your online application. This means that you will need to have completed AND uploaded your scanned transcripts, degree completion certificates (if applicable), Statement of Interest, Resume/CV, ELP results (if applicable) and proof of permanent residence (if applicable) to your online application BEFORE you can click “submit”.

Referees may require 3-4 weeks to complete a reference report.

If, for some reason, you are unable to use the Electronic Referencing System, you can download the reference form ([Referee Report on graduate applicant (pdf)](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/cas/0files/ref_report_grad_applicant.pdf)) and send to your referees for completion. Downloaded reference forms must be sent by the referee DIRECTLY to Connie Carrabs through email ([gradcas@mcmaster.ca](mailto:gradcas@mcmaster.ca))
