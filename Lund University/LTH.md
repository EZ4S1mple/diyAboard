# Applying for studies – when to apply

## When to apply to Bachelor's and Master's studies

Students applying for international Bachelor's or Master's degree programmes in English have the following application periods:

- **Mid-October to 15 January** for studies starting in the autumn semester (August/September). Note that a few programmes do not open for applications until 1 December.
- **Early June to 15 August** for studies starting in the spring semester (January). Note that only a few programmes start in the spring semester each year.

In general, international students can **only** apply to Bachelor's or Master's studies at Lund University during these application periods and through the national application system. The dates refer to the deadline to apply online. After this deadline, students usually have another two weeks to get their documents and their application fee (if applicable) to Sweden.

A few programmes may stay open for applications after the normal application deadline. Please read more under 'Extended application deadline' below.

Note that some programmes at Lund University, such as Fine Arts and the European joint Master's programmes have different application deadlines.
Please see the [fine and performing arts webpage](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/bachelors-masters-studies/subject-areas/fine-and-performing-arts#applying) and the [European joint Master's programmes webpage](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/international-admissions/bachelors-masters-studies/erasmus-mundus-and-other-european-joint-masters) for more information.
