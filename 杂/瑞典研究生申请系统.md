What does officially issued mean?

Officially issued means that your documents must be issued by a representative of the Academic Registrar's Office, the Examinations Office, or the equivalent office that issues official documents of records at your university. Most often, this means that your transcript has been signed and, where appropriate, stamped by the issuing institution (e.g. controller of examination, secretary, registrar, dean or the equivalent). Different countries and universities can have their own methods of certifying that documents are official. If this is the case, we've let you know on your [required documents for your country page](https://www.universityadmissions.se/en/apply-to-masters/provide-application-documents-masters/required-documents/).
